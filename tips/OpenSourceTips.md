- Read projects' contribution guidelines (usually on the CONTRIBUTING.md file at the root or inside the folder `.github`).
- Contribute small and often.
- Fixing typos and adding documentation is valuable! Don't feel the need to make a PR with just code 🙂.
- Sharing your experience with the project, is as much a contribution as a code contribution! For example, write a blog post about how you use a certain library and what problem it solves for you.
- If you are a maintainer of a big project, using Saved Replies can be very helpful when you find yourself repeating the same thing over and over 😅. Take a look at [GitHub's blog post](https://github.blog/2016-03-29-saved-replies/).`
