Raise an [issue to join the EddieHub GitHub organisation](https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/support/issues/new?assignees=&labels=invite+me+to+the+organisation&template=invitation.yml&title=Please+invite+me+to+the+GitHub+Community+Organization).

### Some vague idea of how we could turn this into a support channel.

Imagine the scenario where you are helping a stranger, a friend, or a colleague on Discord / MS Teams / Slack / YouTube, etc. They may have found an old article from 5+ years ago about Docker that is not supported or a Node.js article that isn't supported in Node v14. That sort of thing...

You volunteer to help that person and pair on it. You fix it and they get super happy.

The unfortunate thing about this is that it lacks a write-up on what was used. It's important to know the articles that were used for reference purpose. This is where a GitHub issue queue comes in. That way, folks could Google for somebody with the same problem!

Unfortunately, StackOverflow has a bit of a broken reputation system where folks with the "worst accepted answer" can actually start to get privileges to do more things.

### Ideas

Get your ideas in the GitHub Issue Queue!

If we could find a really good name for this, we could have a `"support"` repo in GitHub profiles, similar to the GitHub username README (n.b. to create `githubusername/githubusername` as a repo then put a README in there.)

We could then have folks to have their own "support" repository and be able to PR in their contributions!

Please check out the [issue queue](https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/support/issues) for sticking issues with this and we can all pair on this.

## FAQ
- **What is a GitHub Organization?** Essentially it's a way to group many repositories in an entity called an organization. An organization also allows us to group people who contribute and are a part of the community. Some examples would be: [Netflix](https://github.com/Netflix), [Facebook](https://github.com/facebook) and of course [EddieHub](https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity).
Learn more on [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/about-organizations).

- **What is DevRel?** Check out the discussion on [this issue](https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/support/issues/64) or on [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUZerHctTB8&t=1534s).
- **How do I get started with open source?** You can make your first pull request in this [repository](https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/hacktoberfest-practice). Follow the instructions in the README, and don't forget – contributing to open source is not just about code – it's about collaboration, communication, and adding value. Don't be afraid to open an issue with a question :smiley:. If you have any trouble, you can ask questions in our Discord. We have a channel for `first-timers` and `opensource`.
