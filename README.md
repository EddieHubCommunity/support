## FAQs

- **Q1 What is a GitHub Organization?** 
- **Ans:** Essentially it's a way to group many repositories. An organization also allows us to group people who contribute to and are a part of the community. Some examples would be - [Netflix](https://github.com/Netflix), [Facebook](https://github.com/facebook), and of course [EddieHub](https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity).
  Learn more on [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/about-organizations).

- **Q6 How do I get started with open source?**
- **Ans:** You can make your first pull request in this [repository](https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/hacktoberfest-practice). Follow the instructions in the README, and don't forget – contributing to open source is not just about code – it's about collaboration, communication, and adding value. Don't be afraid to open an issue with a question :smiley:. If you have any trouble, you can ask questions in our Discord. We have a channel for `first-timers` and `opensource`.
