Invitation will be sent for the GitHub Organization soon. We look forward to having you part of our community :nerd_face:
Don't forget after accepting to make it public so it appears on your github profile for everyone else to see, you can do this by finding your name in the github organization list and change the dropdown to public https://github.com/orgs/EddieJaoudeCommunity/people
Tips for practicing:
- Customise your GitHub profile, here is a live stream on it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT6GXCuS0Zo
- Practice repo, instructions how to add your name to the README in the README https://github.com/EddieJaoudeCommunity/hacktoberfest-practice
- Remember contributing to open source is not just about code, its about collaboration, communication and adding value
I hope that helps
