An invitation for the GitHub Organization will be sent soon. We look forward to having you part of our community :nerd_face:
Don't forget after accepting to make it public so it appears on your GitHub profile for everyone else to see, you can do this by finding your name in the GitHub organization list and change the dropdown to public https://github.com/orgs/EddieHubCommunity/people
Tips for practicing:
- Customise your GitHub profile, here is a live stream on it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT6GXCuS0Zo
- Practice repo, instructions on how to add your name to the README in the README https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/hacktoberfest-practice
- Remember contributing to open source is not just about code, its about collaboration, communication, and adding value

I hope that helps
