- Take a look at [firsttimersonly](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/). Some projects have a label for "first timers only", so look for that if you haven't contributed to the project before (e.g. [Spring Boot's repo](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues?q=label%3A%22status%3A+first-timers-only%22+is%3Aclosed))
