# Open Source tips for beginners

- Read projects' contribution guidelines (usually on the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file at the root or inside the `.github` folder).
- Contribute small and often.
- Fixing typos and adding documentation is valuable! Don't feel the need to make a PR with just code :slightly_smiling_face:
- Sharing your experience with the project is as much a contribution as a code contribution! For example, write a blog post about how you use a certain library and what problem solves.
- If you are a maintainer of a big project, using Saved Replies can be very helpful when you find yourself repeating the same thing over and over :sweat_smile: Take a look at a [GitHub's blog post](https://github.blog/2016-03-29-saved-replies/).
