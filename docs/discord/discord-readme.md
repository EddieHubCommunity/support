# Welcome to the EddieHubCommunity Discord server

We believe Open Source is for everyone, yes you!
OPEN SOURCE is NOT about code, it is about people and collaboration.
We are invested in getting you those green squares on GitHub! Contributing to Open Source Software (OSS) is a great way for you to learn, work with different people and also network. You'll find awesome people here who will guide you and if you're a beginner in open source, keep an eye on #first-timers. If you get stuck somewhere feel free to ask for help in the community, you'll find someone who can help you for sure and others will learn along too!

**Please try to adhere by our Code Of Conduct (COC):**

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.
We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.
The following are the guidelines regarding chat on the discord server:

- Full details can be found at <https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/support/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>
- In addition to our code of conduct, members should follow Discord's community guidelines (<https://discord.com/guidelines>) as well

**Enforcement:**

Instances of abusive, harassing or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be reported by contacting the @moderators. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

EddieBotDev (or EddieBot) would be monitoring language used on the Discord server to ensure the inclusive and welcoming language in the Discord server. EddieBot suggests alternatives and it would be a good practice to edit your message reflecting the suggestion.

**NOTE:** EddieBot is still in development, and there might be a few words flagged by it that should not have been flagged. Open an issue on the repo and get a green square!

**How to ask for help**
Tips to help you ask questions that will give you a better chance to get the best answers from everyone.

1. **Read through your code first.** Your problem could be as simple as a typo or a missing closing tag.
2. **Ask Google.** Many code problems can be solved with a quick Google, so give this a try first. If that doesn't help, head back here to ask your question, and follow the tips below.
3. **Clearly describe the problem.** Explain what is happening and what you want to happen.
4. **Share your code.** Itâ€™s very unlikely that anyone will be able to solve your problem without seeing your code. Share a GitHub repository, a GitHub gist link, or format the code by wrapping it in backticks, like the example below.

````txt
```ts
  // Your code goes here
```
````

<!-- markdownlint-disable ol-prefix -->

5. **Send screenshots, if relevant.** It often helps people to see the browser output, so send over a screenshot of what you can see, in this case.
6. **Explain what you have already tried.** You don't want people to suggest things you have already done.
7. **Send updates so people know whether their answer has helped you.**
8. **Help other people out when you can.** If people see you helping others, they will be even more likely to help you when you need it.

## Roles

Our server has several roles you can assign to yourself, such as roles for your specific tech stack or roles that we ping for certain events.

To see the roles that are available, head over to #bot-chat and use the command `becca!role`. Becca will send a list of the roles you can assign to yourself.

To assign a role, use `/community role <role name>` and Becca will give you that role. For example, if I wanted the `angular` role, I would send the command `/community role angular`.
