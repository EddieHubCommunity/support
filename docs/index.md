# Welcome

Welcome to the EddieHub Support resource.

Imagine the scenario where you are helping a stranger, a friend, or a colleague on Discord / MS Teams / Slack / YouTube, etc. They may have found an old article from 5+ years ago about Docker that is not supported or a Node.js article that isn't supported in Node v14. That sort of thing...

You volunteer to help that person and pair on it. You fix it and they get super happy.

The unfortunate thing about this is that it lacks a write-up on what was used. It's important to know the articles that were used for reference purpose. This is where a GitHub issue queue comes in. That way, folks could Google for somebody with the same problem!

Unfortunately, StackOverflow has a bit of a broken reputation system where folks with the "worst accepted answer" can actually start to get privileges to do more things.
