As a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like you to follow:

## <a name="commit"></a> Commit Message Guidelines ðŸ˜Ž

In order to make git commit messages **easier to read** and faster to reason about, we follow some guidelines on most commits to keep the **format predictable**. Check [Conventional Commits specification](https://conventionalcommits.org) for more information about our guidelines.

**Examples**:

```
docs(changelog): update changelog to beta.5
docs: add API documentation to the bot
test(server): add cache tests to the movie resource
fix(web): add validation to phone input field
fix(web): remove avatar image from being required in form
fix(release): need to depend on latest rxjs and zone.js
```

### Type

Must be one of the following:

- **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm).
- **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

### Becoming an EddieHub Maintainer

EddieHub is all about open source collaboration. We want it to be a place which is inclusive and welcoming for all and therefore, our maintainers are carefully chosen from those we see upholding the EddieHub guiding principles of collaboration first, code second, making quality contributions to EddieHub over a longer period of time and those that follow the [CODE of CONDUCT](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Please donâ€™t ask to become a maintainer; instead, show your interest and potential through quality contributions. Our moderation team regularly discusses which contributors make a positive impact on the community. Those seen regularly making a positive impact in line with our code of conduct will be extended an invite to join the maintainer team.
