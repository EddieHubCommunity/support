EddieBotDev (or EddieBot), would be monitoring language used on the discord server, to ensure inclusive and welcoming language in the discord server. EddieBot suggests alternatives and it would be a good practice to edit your message, reflecting the suggestion

NOTE: EddieBot is still in development, and there might be a few words flagged by it which should not have been flagged. Open an issue on the repo and get a green square!
