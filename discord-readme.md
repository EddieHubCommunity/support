EddieBotDev (or EddieBot), would be monitoring language used on the discord server, to ensure inclusive and welcoming language in the discord server. EddieBot suggests alternatives and it would be a good practice to edit your message, reflecting the suggestion

NOTE: EddieBot is still in development, and there might be a few words flagged by it which should not have been flagged. Open an issue on the repo and get a green square!

**How to ask for help**
Tips to help you ask questions which will give you a better chance to get the best answers from everyone.

1. **Read through your code first** Your problem could be as simple as a typo or a missing closing tag. 
2. **Ask Google** Many code problems can be solved with a quick Google, so give this a try first. If that doesn't help, head back here to ask your question, and follow the tips below.
3. **Clearly describe the problem.** Explain what is happening and what you want to happen. 
4. **Share your code.** Itâ€™s very unlikely that anyone will be able to solve your problem without seeing your code. Share a GitHub repository, a GitHub gist link or format the code by wrapping it in backticks , like the example below. 

    ```
      //Your code goes here
    ```

5. **Send screenshots, if relevant** It often helps people to see the browser output, so send over a screenshot of what you can see, in this case. 
6. **Explain what you have already tried.**  You don't want people to suggest things you have already done. 
7. **Send updates so people know whether their answer has helped you.** 
8. **Help other people out when you can.** If people see you helping others, they will be even more likely to help you when you need it.
