**Enforcement:**

Instances of abusive, harassing or otherwise, unacceptable behaviour may be reported by contacting the @moderators . All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

EddieBotDev (or EddieBot), would be monitoring language used on the discord server, to ensure inclusive and welcoming language in the discord server. EddieBot suggests alternatives and it would be a good practice to edit your message, reflecting the suggestion

NOTE: EddieBot is still in development, and there might be a few words flagged by it which should not have been flagged. Open an issue on the repo and get a green square!
