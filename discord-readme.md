EddieBotDev (or EddieBot), would be monitoring language used on the discord server, to ensure the inclusive and welcoming language in the discord server. EddieBot suggests alternatives and it would be a good practice to edit your message, reflecting the suggestion

**How to ask for help**
Tips to help you ask questions that will give you a better chance to get the best answers from everyone.

1. **Read through your code first.** Your problem could be as simple as a typo or a missing closing tag.
2. **Ask Google.** Many code problems can be solved with a quick Google, so give this a try first. If that doesn't help, head back here to ask your question, and follow the tips below.
3. **Clearly describe the problem.** Explain what is happening and what you want to happen.
4. **Share your code.** It’s very unlikely that anyone will be able to solve your problem without seeing your code. Share a GitHub repository, a GitHub gist link, or format the code by wrapping it in backticks, like the example below.

   ```
     //Your code goes here
   ```

5. **Send screenshots, if relevant.** It often helps people to see the browser output, so send over a screenshot of what you can see, in this case.
6. **Explain what you have already tried.** You don't want people to suggest things you have already done.
7. **Send updates so people know whether their answer has helped you.**
8. **Help other people out when you can.** If people see you helping others, they will be even more likely to help you when you need it.
9. **Roles**

    Our server has several roles you can assign to yourself, such as roles for your specific tech stack or roles that we ping for certain events. 

    To see the roles that are available, head over to #bot-chat and use the command `becca!role`. Becca will send a list of the roles you can assign to yourself.

    To assign a role, use `becca!role <role name>` and Becca will give you that role. For example, if I wanted the `angular` role, I would send the command `becca!role angular`.
